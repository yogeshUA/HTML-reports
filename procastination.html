              Procrastination Assessment is a tool to aid in gaining a
              comprehensive understanding of the applicant's and/or current
              employees' level of procrastination. With such insights, it is
              possible to explain and predict their behavior under tight work
              schedules.

        <p class="intro_content">
          According to P. Arousal Steel, we have different levels of a tendency
          to delay or postpone tasks or actions, often despite knowing that
          doing so may have negative consequences. This scale measures the level
          of procrastination through 9 items. Each item contains a statement
          describing the feelings experienced before starting any task.
          Respondents rate how accurate these feelings and thoughts are, on a
          four-point scale from Very Seldom or not true of me to Very often true
          of me.

        <p class="intro_sub_heading">Meaning of factor</p>
        <p class="intro_content">
          Procrastination is the act of delaying or postponing something,
          especially out of a tendency to avoid doing tasks that are perceived
          as unpleasant or tedious.

          The applicant has an average score in procrastination. This means that
          they may not experience significant negative consequences from their
          tendency to delay tasks, but they may still struggle with
          procrastination from time to time. They may be able to meet deadlines
          and complete important tasks, but they may not do so as efficiently or
          effectively as they could if they were more proactive and focused.
          They get easily distracted by external factors, such as social media,
          phone notifications, or other forms of entertainment. They may feel
          that they work better under pressure, and may intentionally delay
          starting tasks in order to give themselves a sense of urgency.

          Procrastination is normal and common human behavior, and it does not
          necessarily indicate a lack of motivation or productivity. It is only
          when procrastination becomes chronic or severely impacts a person's
          ability to meet their goals then it may become a problem that requires
          intervention.
