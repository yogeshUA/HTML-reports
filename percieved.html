        <p class="intro_content">
          According to A. Shahid et al, we have a tendency to either undermine
          or amplify our sense of stress based on how we think about ourselves
          and the world. This questionnaire measures this level of perceived
          stress through 30 items. Each item contains a statement describing the
          situation and feelings experienced about the daily hassles.
          Respondents rate how often they experience these feelings and thoughts
          on a four-point scale from Rarely to Usually.

        <p class="intro_sub_heading">Meaning of factor</p>
        <p class="intro_content">
          Perceived stress refers to an individual's subjective perception of
          the degree to which situations are appraised as stressful. It is a
          measure of how much stress a person feels they are under and is
          determined by their personal perception of the demands placed on them,
          their ability to cope with those demands, and their emotional and
          physiological responses to those demands.
