          According to M. J. Miller, D. J. Woehr, and N. Hudspeth, there are
          seven different dimensions of work ethics that each individual is
          inclined towards based on how we think about ourselves and the world.
          This questionnaire measures these dimensions through 28 items. Each
          item contains a statement describing the thoughts, feeling or behavior
          while working. Respondents rate how often they indulge in the behavior
          described in each statement on a five-point scale from Strongly
          Disagree to Strongly Agree.

            rewards in order to achieve a long-term goal or objective. This
            indicates that they may have difficulty postponing immediate
            pleasure or rewards, and may be impulsive in their decision-making.
            They may find it challenging to make short-term sacrifices in order
            to achieve long-term goals. This can be associated with low levels
            of persistence, low self-discipline, and low motivation to achieve
            long-term goals. They are less likely to plan and set goals and may
            be less productive than others.
