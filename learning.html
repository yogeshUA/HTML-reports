          According to Honey and Mumford, we have an inclination toward a
          specific style of learning, most natural to us, based on how we think
          about ourselves and the world. This questionnaire measures four
          learning styles through 40 items. Each item contains a statement
          describing the thoughts and approaches while trying something new.
          Respondents respond whether they relate to the behavior described in
          each statement by selecting Yes or No.

            The candidate scored high on the Activist subscale. This suggests
            that they are content to let the present moment rule their lives and
            appreciate the here and now. They tend to be excited about
            everything new since they are open-minded and not skeptical. They
            frequently take action before thinking about the results. They are
            very active during the day. They brainstorm to tackle difficulties.
            They start hunting for the next action as soon as the first
            excitement has subsided. The challenge of novel experiences tends to
            excite them, whereas execution and long-term consolidation wear them
            out. They are social individuals who are always interacting with
            others, but they also aim to center all activities around
            themselves.

            The applicant has scored low on the Reflector subscale. This

            step back and observing before making a decision. Instead of taking
            the time to learn more and consider their options, they might prefer
            to take action right away and make decisions based on what they know
            right now. Additionally, they could be less likely to assess their
            own performance and learning, as well as less eager to seek out
            comments from others.

            The applicant has scored high on the Theorist subscale. This
            suggests that they approach challenges systematically and
            methodically. They combine various facts into comprehensible
            theories. They have a tendency to be perfectionists who won't feel
            at ease unless everything is organized and makes perfect sense. They
            enjoy analyzing and synthesizing. They have a strong interest in
            fundamental presumptions, rules, theories, models, and systemic
            thinking. Their main concerns are logicality and reason. They are
            typically analytical, detached, and committed to rational
            objectivity over anything confusing or subjective. Their method of
            solving issues is constantly logical. Anything that doesn't conform
            to their mindset is categorically rejected. They desire to have as
            much clarity as possible and dislike making subjective decisions,
            thinking outside the box, or being irreverent.
