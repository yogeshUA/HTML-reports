          According to S. Sanatkar and M. Rubin, we have an inclination towards
          one of the two approaches to solving a problem that feels most natural
          to us based on how we think about ourselves and the world. This
          questionnaire measures two problem-solving approaches through 10
          items. Each item contains a statement describing the situation and
          behavior while dealing with problems. Respondents rate how accurate
          these statements are to their personnel behavior on a seven-point
          scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree.
