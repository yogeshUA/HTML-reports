          According to James Hamilton, communication is influenced by three
          factors, each of which influences a person's communication style
          differently. This scale measures the Locus of control while
          communicating, through 17 items. Each item contains a statement
          describing the general feelings about public speaking in particular
          and communication in general. Respondents rate how accurate these
          feelings and thoughts are, on a four-point scale from Strongly
          Disagree to Strongly Agree.
