              The Grit Scale is a tool to aid in gaining a comprehensive

          According to Angela Duckworth, we have different levels of
          determination and ability to maintain focus and effort over a
          prolonged period of time. This scale measures the level of grit
          through 10 items. Each item contains a statement describing the
          feelings experienced before and during challenging circumstances.
          Respondents rate how accurate these feelings and thoughts are, on a
          five-point scale from Very much like me to Not at all like me.

          refers to a person’s passion and perseverance for long-term goals.
          Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort
          and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in
          progress.
